# Portfolio + First-Party Analytics

A personal portfolio site with a **privacy-first, self-built visitor analytics pipeline**.
The public site is pure React (Next.js App Router, Server Components). The only server
endpoint in the whole project is a single tracking route — everything else renders
statically or reads the database directly through Supabase with row-level security.

The analytics layer is deliberately hand-rolled rather than dropped in from a SaaS. It is
cookieless, stores no raw IP addresses, and uses a daily-rotating hash so no visitor is
trackable across days. It exists both to answer a real question — *which channels actually
drive traffic to my site during a job search* — and to serve as a compact, reviewable
demonstration of full-stack design.

## Highlights

- **Pure-React public site.** Portfolio content ships as static Server Components. No
  client-side data fetching, no API round-trips to view a page.
- **One API route, by design.** `POST /api/track` is the only custom server endpoint.
  Auth and dashboard reads go directly through Supabase.
- **Cookieless, GDPR-minded analytics.** No cookies, no localStorage identifiers, no raw
  IPs at rest. Visitors are identified by a salted daily hash that cannot be linked across
  days. See [`docs/ANALYTICS.md`](docs/ANALYTICS.md).
- **Owner-only dashboard.** A protected `/dashboard` route shows page views, unique
  visitors, sessions, referrers, UTM breakdowns, and geography. Access is enforced by
  Supabase Auth + Postgres row-level security.
- **Runs on free tiers.** Vercel Hobby + Supabase Free comfortably cover a personal site.

## Quick start

Full instructions are in [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md). The short version:

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in Supabase keys + salt secret

# 3. Apply the database schema
#    (paste supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql into the Supabase SQL editor,
#     or use the Supabase CLI — see docs/SETUP.md)

# 4. Run
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

## A note on privacy

This project is built to collect the minimum data needed to understand traffic, and to
avoid storing anything that identifies an individual. It is designed with GDPR/CCPA
principles in mind (no cookies, no persistent identifiers, no raw IPs at rest). It is not
legal advice — if you deploy your own version, confirm your own obligations. The privacy
posture is documented in full in [`docs/ANALYTICS.md`](docs/ANALYTICS.md#privacy-posture).
